## About <a name = "about"></a>
This repo presents a computational approach of designing a cam-linkage mechanism to make a point exactly move along a prescribed 3D path, driven by a single actuator.
We implemented our computational design tool in C++ and `libigl` [Jacobson et al. 2018] on a desktop computer with 3.6 GHz 8-Core Intel processor and 16 GB RAM.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
Our code can be ran on MacOS and Unbuntu (Linux) system. First clone the repository, run CMake to generate Makefiles or CMake/Visual Studio project files, and the rest should just work automatically.


### Compilation

- **MacOS and Ubuntu(Linux)**:

```
cd [current folder path]
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
It's better to build it with `release` because of CGAL.
This should find and build the dependencies and create a `SpatialLinkages_rMain` binary.

- **Windows**: currently unavailable.


## GUI Interface <a name = "usage"></a>
The control panel is shown below. There are 4 components in the control panel: 
**Optimization Process**, **I/O files**, **Operation Control**, **Render Control**.

- ### Parameter Control

  `Read Input Curve`  Read an input curve from folder `/data/InputCurves`

  `Optimization` Optimize a mechanism to realize the input curve.

- ### I/O files

  `Read CamLinkage` Our program can read `mats.dat` files from folder `/data/Demo`

- ### Operation Control

  `Stop Motion`/`Restart Motion` Interruption or continuation of movement

  `Motion Speed` Adjust the motion velocity

- ### Render Control
  Control the object visualization state.

## Show the demo <a name = "show_demo"></a>
You can show the demo by clicking `Read Camlinkage`, importing any `mats.dat` file from the folder `/data/Demo`.
Following is an example about `tennisCurve`:

## Create a cam-linkage mechanism <a name = "create_mech"></a>
These instructions give an example to you of how to use our code to generate a cam-linkage mechanism by yourself.

### Step 1: import an input curve
Import any input curve file by clicking `Read Input Curve` button.

### Step 2: optimize a mechanism 
Click the `Optimization` button. It would cost about an hour! Break for a cup of coffee.

### Step 3: control the movement
Use `Restart Motion`,`Stop Motion`,`Motion Speed` to control the movement. Use mouse to adjust the camera view.
